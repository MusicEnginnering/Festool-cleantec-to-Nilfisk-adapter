# Festool-cleantec-to-Nilfisk-adapter
This respository contains all the model and print files, as well as images of the final product, that being the adapter between a festool cleantec connector and a Nilfisk hose connector. 

This adapter should work for the Nilfisk hose that fits on a:
 - Nilfisk Alto Aero 21
 - Nilfisk Alto Aero 26
 - Nilfisk Alto Aero 31
 - Nilfisk Multi 20
 - Nilfisk Multi 30

This is a test on the hose to a Nilfisk 20 and the festool cleantec connector that comes with the TS 75 Circular saw.

I hope this model may be useful for someone else too!

This model is made in software that requires all models only be used for non-commercial purposes, so you can't legally use the model commercially.
If you distribute, make a fork or use the files for something please give me (MusicEngineering) credit.
