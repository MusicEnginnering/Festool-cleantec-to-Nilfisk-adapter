# Festool-cleantec-to-Nilfisk-adapter
This respository contains all the model and print files, as well as images of the final product, that being the adapter between a festool cleantec connector and a Nilfisk hose connector. 

## Compatibility
This adapter should work for the Nilfisk hose that fits on a:
 - Nilfisk Alto Aero 21
 - Nilfisk Alto Aero 26
 - Nilfisk Alto Aero 31
 - Nilfisk Multi 20
 - Nilfisk Multi 30

This is a test on the hose to a Nilfisk 20 and the festool cleantec connector that comes with the TS 75 Circular saw.

## Assembly instructions
Print either the two halfs of the adapter separately or print the single-piece adapter as one 3d print.
Regardless, when you have printed the part(s) you can reinforce the print with six M3 bolts and nuts. The bolts should have a shaft length of at least 47.8mm to fully grip a standard M3 nut (with a height of 2.4mm).
1) Place the nuts in the hexagonal indents in the Nilfisk end of the adapter.
2) Add superglue to all surfaces where parts of the assembly will touch eachother.
2a) If applicable, join the two halfs of the adapter.
3) Screw in the six M3 bolts
4) Let the superglue harden
5) Happy sawing! (now with less sawdust everywhere)

I hope this model may be useful for someone else too!
